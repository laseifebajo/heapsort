# Jupyter Repeat

#Introduction
My name is Toluwalase Ifebajo. My evaluation for Graph Theory, Summer 2021–2022, can be found on this github page. This notebook's objective is to demonstrate my comprehension and learning outcomes from the Graph Theory module in third-year software development at ATU.

# Module

Graph Theory

The study of graph theory, a type of mathematical structure used to represent pair-wise interactions between items in a collection, is known as graph theory. Vertices (nodes/points) and edges (lines) in graph theory are used to depict these relationships. To show the concepts in this notebook, which involve heap sort and graph isomorphism, we shall use graph theory.

# Content

For this module we were asked to discuss the following two:

Heap sort
In computer science, heapsort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm.

Within this notebook we discuss:

Discuss what is the Heap Sort algorithm.
Implementing Python function for Heap Sort.
Explain the computational complexity of Heap Sort.
Explain how graph theory is used in Heap Sort.
Graph Isomorphism problem
The graph isomorphism problem is the computational problem of determining whether two finite graphs are isomorphic.

Within this notebook we discuss:

Discussing what is the Graph Iomorphism Problem.
Explain how graphs can be represented in data structures.
Create a Python function implementing an algorithm to determine if two graphs are isomorphic or not.
Discussion of the computational complexity of the Graph Isomorphism Problem.
